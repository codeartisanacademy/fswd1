    <p id="content" style="color:orange;">On 9 March 2020, the government of Italy under Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte imposed a national quarantine on the entire country, restricting the movement of the population except for necessity, work, and health circumstances, in response to the growing outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. This followed an earlier restriction announced the previous day which affected sixteen million people and included the region of Lombardy and fourteen neighbouring provinces in Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, and Marche, and further back a smaller-scale <br>lockdown of eleven municipalities in the province of Lodi that had begun by late February.</p><p id="link">
