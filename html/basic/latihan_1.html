    <h1>Coffin Stone</h1>
    <p>The Coffin Stone, also known as the Coffin and the Table Stone, is a large sarsen stone at the foot of Blue Bell
        Hill near Aylesford in the south-eastern English county of Kent. Now lying horizontally on the ground, the stone
        probably once stood upright nearby. Various archaeologists have argued that the stone was part of a
        now-destroyed chambered long barrow constructed in the fourth millennium BCE, during Britain's Early Neolithic
        period.</p>
    <p>If a chambered long barrow did indeed previously exist on the site, it would have been built by pastoralist
        communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Long-barrow
        building was an architectural tradition widespread across Neolithic Europe. It consisted of various localized
        regional variants; one of these was in the vicinity of the River Medway, examples of which are now known as the
        Medway Megaliths. The Coffin Stone lies on the eastern side of the river, not far from the chambered long
        barrows of Little Kit's Coty House, Kit's Coty House, and the (now destroyed) Smythe's Megalith. Three other
        examples, the Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and Chestnuts Long Barrow, remain on the western side
        of the river.</p>
